Database Title: TMDB Movies Data

Data Source: This database contains data extracted from TMDB (The Movie Database), a popular online resource used for comprehensive movie information.

Database Content: 
The database includes details on various movies such as titles, casts, directors, production companies, budgets, revenues, and much more. Specific details include:
ID and IMDb ID for unique references
Original Title
Popularity, Budget, Revenue
Cast, Director
Runtime of the movie
Genres
Release Date
Average Vote and Vote Count

File Structure: The database is provided in a CSV format, featuring several columns including id, imdb_id, popularity, budget, revenue, original_title, cast, director, runtime, genres, release_date, vote_average, release_year, budget_adj (budget adjusted for inflation), and revenue_adj (revenues adjusted for inflation).

Data Usage: After cleaning up the dataset, I became interested in understanding the profit generated by each film. My analysis revealed that 37% of the movies made a profit ranging from 
10M to 100M. Intriguingly, 25% of the films did not generate any profit at all. Notably, 'The Lone Ranger' emerged as the least profitable film in the dataset
After analyzing the profits, I became curious to understand which movies performed the best in terms of both revenue and Return on Investment (ROI). 
Pursuing this inquiry, I discovered that the top two films in terms of ROI and Revenue were 'The Net' and 'Minions'. Despite having lower budgets, 
they managed to achieve significantly high profits and garnered revenues comparable to the most well-known films.
